Predicting Respiratory Disease Percentages: A Regression Modeling Project
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the percentage of cases related to various respiratory diseases (such as ILI, RSV, COVID-19, etc.) based on various features such as demographic and temporal information. Multiple regression models are implemented and evaluated for their performance, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR). The goal is to determine the best-performing model based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) scores.

Additionally, feature importance is analyzed to understand which features most influence the prediction.

Project Background
Respiratory diseases are a major concern, particularly during seasonal outbreaks (e.g., flu, RSV, COVID-19). Accurate prediction of disease prevalence can help with better resource planning and public health interventions. The dataset used in this project contains multiple features, including temporal data (week, season), respiratory categories, and demographic groups, which help in predicting the percentage of disease cases.

Data
The dataset includes the following key features:

percent: The percentage of cases for a particular disease in a given time period.
week: Week of the year when the data was collected.
season_2016-2017: The season during which the data was recorded.
respiratory_category_*ILI, RSV, COVID-19, etc.: Categories of respiratory diseases.
*demographic_group_ (Age groups, etc.)**: Different demographic categories.
essence_category_*: Various essence categories indicating data relevance (e.g., CDC Influenza, RSV).
Data Preprocessing Steps
Missing data handling (e.g., imputation).
Feature scaling using StandardScaler (Standardizing the data to have mean = 0, and standard deviation = 1).
Encoding categorical features as required for modeling.
Model Implementation
The following regression models were implemented and evaluated:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model for predicting continuous values.
Decision Tree Regressor: A tree-based model that splits data into decision nodes.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble model consisting of multiple decision trees.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: Another ensemble method where weak learners are added sequentially.
Support Vector Regressor (SVR): A model based on Support Vector Machines, which tries to find the hyperplane that best fits the data.
The models are trained using the training dataset and evaluated using the test dataset. Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) are calculated to evaluate the model performance.

Evaluation and Results
Random Forest Regressor was found to perform the best with the lowest MSE (0.0223), MAE (0.0815), and the highest R² (93.97%).
Decision Tree Regressor followed as the second-best model, with an R² score of 89.26%.
Gradient Boosting Regressor provided solid results, but not as strong as Random Forest and Decision Tree.
Linear Regression underperformed with a lower R² score (64.4%) and higher MSE and MAE values compared to the other models.
Training vs Testing Performance
The Random Forest model showed no significant overfitting, with only a small difference in performance between training (R² = 99.11%) and test data (R² = 93.97%).

Feature Importance
Using the Random Forest Regressor, the following features were identified as the most important:

mmwr_week: The week of the year.
respiratory_category_ILI: Respiratory illness category (Influenza-like Illness).
demographic_group_Age Unknown: Unknown age group.
essence_category_CDC Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Data related to RSV.
respiratory_category_Influenza: Influenza-related cases.
These features significantly contribute to predicting the percentage of cases and are important for model decision-making.

Visualization
Several visualizations were created to explore the data and model performance:

Histogram and Boxplot for the 'percent' feature.
KDE plot for the smooth distribution of 'percent'.
Violin Plot for showing distribution with respect to categorical features.
Correlation Heatmap to visualize the relationship between numerical features.
Scatter plots to investigate relationships between selected variables.
Feature Importance Plot for Random Forest to show which features influence the prediction most.
How to Run the Code
To run the project, follow the steps below:

1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, and then install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
2. Load and Preprocess Data
Make sure to load the dataset into your Python environment using pandas:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_dataset.csv')
Preprocess the data as described in the project, including handling missing values and feature scaling.

3. Train and Evaluate Models
Run the regression models section of the code, where the models will be trained and evaluated using the training and testing datasets.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Example for training a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
4. Visualizations
For visualizations, simply run the code for each plot type. Ensure to have matplotlib and seaborn installed for the plots to work correctly.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.histplot(df['percent'], kde=True)
