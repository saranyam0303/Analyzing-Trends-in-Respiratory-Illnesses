# Analyzing-Trends-in-Respiratory-Illnesses


## INTRODUCTION :

Understanding respiratory illnesses like influenza, COVID-19, and RSV is crucial for public health. This project will analyze a dataset from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), which includes weekly data on emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory conditions.

We will explore how different factors, such as age and race/ethnicity, affect the number of visits related to these illnesses. By using machine learning techniques, we aim to identify trends and make predictions about future cases.

Our analysis will include various methods to find patterns in the data, helping healthcare providers and public health officials better respond to respiratory illness outbreaks. This project seeks to provide valuable insights that can improve health outcomes and resource management during peak illness seasons.

## Goal of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to analyze trends in respiratory illnesses using machine learning techniques to enhance understanding and response strategies. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Identify Trends: Examine weekly data on emergency department visits and hospital admissions to uncover patterns in respiratory illnesses over time.

2. Evaluate Demographic Factors: Analyze how demographic factors such as age and race/ethnicity influence the rates of respiratory illnesses.

3. Predict Future Cases: Develop predictive models that can forecast future trends in respiratory illness visits, aiding in proactive public health planning.

4. Support Decision-Making: Provide actionable insights for healthcare providers and public health officials to improve resource allocation and response efforts during peak illness seasons.
